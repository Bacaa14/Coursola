						<p>In May 2014, I will graduate with double degrees in
							computer science and chemistry engineering from Washington & Lee
							University in Lexington, Virginia.</p>
						<br>
						<p>My major coursework has included classes in Organic
							Chemistry, Algorithms, Ordinary Differential Equations, and
							Software Development. In chemistry, I was selected to work with
							Professor Marcia France as an advanced organic chemistry research
							assistant. I am currently beginning to work with Professor Joshua
							Stough on an independent study leading to an honors senior thesis
							in the area of machine learning.</p>
						<br>
						<p>As a liberal arts student, I have studied a wide variety of
							subjects in addition to my major courses. Outside of my majors, I
							have taken courses that focus on creative and analytical
							thinking, unbiased judgment and decision making, communication
							and understanding. I have, for example, taken courses such as
							‘The Knight and Society,’ 'Microeconomic Theory,' and ‘The
							Philosophy of Logic’ which have allowed me to approach problems
							from new directions. In addition, participation in the
							University-Shenandoah Symphony Orchestra and the Varsity Swim
							team have provided me with ways to challenge myself outside the
							classroom. Recently, the university's program in Leadership
							selected me as the Head Trip Leader for the 2013-2014 leadership
							program. These experiences have greatly complimented my major
							coursework.</p>
						<br>
						<p>My ultimate goal is to apply my skills to the business
							world.</p>

							I am a senior, very nearly an alumnus, at Washington and Lee with double majors
							in physics and computer science.  Over the past four years, I've been amping up
							experience in human-oriented computing.  I've conducted research at Iowa State's Virtual
							Reality Applications Center and University of Southern California's Interaction Lab.
							Back at W&L, I have worked as an Intro Computer Science TA, an ITS Help Desk Employee, 
							and as Head Tech Advisor for an on-campus organization.  I find the most fun and interesting
							parts of computer science to be those most closely tied to revolutionizing the ways that users
							interact with technology in both applications and interfacing.  This fall, I'll be beginning
							the Computer Science PhD program at Georgia Tech's School of Interactive Computing.
